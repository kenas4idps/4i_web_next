### Husky

We use husky to hook git with code formatting, linting, builds, and commit message linting.

- pre-commit: format code
- commit-msg: lint every commit message to adhere to [conventional commit message standard](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). This is to ensure that every commit message will be in the same format.
- pre-push: format code, lint code, build code before pushing to remote repo
